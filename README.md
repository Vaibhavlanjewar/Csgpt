# 🔹 BTech Prep Buddy

Computer Science and IT students often face challenges when preparing for core subjects like **Operating Systems**, **Database Management Systems**, **Computer Networks**, and various programming languages including **Object-Oriented Programming**.

**BTech Prep Buddy** is a web-based solution designed to address these challenges. It leverages the **Gemini API** to generate AI-powered responses on the frontend. 

One of the standout features is a **well-organized sidebar** that lists all major subjects along with their most important subtopics.

This system serves as a centralized platform to enhance academic preparation and interview readiness — solving real-world learning difficulties in a single, interactive interface.
